- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently the Founder & CEO @ [Pentestify](https://pentestify.io), a startup that automatically detects smart contract security vulnerabilities post-deployment using state-of-the-art AI. I am equally the Founder of [zkToro](https://zktoro.com), a DeFi protocol to unlock blockchain's social trading potential and the Co-Founder of [Web3Sec](https://web3sec.news), the world's largest blockchain security news aggregator newsletter.

 - ðŸŒ± I'm driving the alignment between artificial intelligence and blockchain security, to ensure that web3 does not look anything like 1984.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always keen and happy to collaborate in the following areas: DeFi, blockchain and smart contract security, cutting-edge AI (DRL, GNNs, LLMs, etc.), zero-knowledge proofs, and entrepreneurship.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking forward to surrounding myself with exceptionally talented fellow professionals.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about blockchain, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, finance, entrepreneurship, engineering, electronics, among many other interesting topics!
