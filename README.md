- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently the Founder & CEO @ [Pentestify](https://pentestify.io), a startup that automatically detects smart contract security vulnerabilities post-deployment using state-of-the-art AI and creates zero-day smart contract exploits. I am equally the Founder of [zkToro](https://zktoro.com), the default infrastructure for financial institutions to create, share and execute cross-chain their expert crypto quant trading strategies, w/o disclosing their IP. Also, I am the Co-Founder of [Web3Sec](https://web3sec.news), the world's largest blockchain security newsletter.

 - ðŸŒ± I'm pioneering the intersection between artificial intelligence and blockchain security, to ensure that web3 does not look anything like 1984, currently focused on DeFi.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always keen and happy to collaborate in the following areas: DeFi, blockchain and smart contract security, cutting-edge AI (DRL, GNNs, LLMs, etc.), zero-knowledge proofs, FHE (full homomorphic encryption), and entrepreneurship.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking forward to surrounding myself with exceptionally talented fellow professionals.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about blockchain, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, finance, entrepreneurship, engineering, electronics, among many other interesting topics! I am a frequent speaker at [DeFi Security Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFS0JTh6MCI&ab_channel=DeFiSecuritySummit), [DappCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SFsGFiycSk&ab_channel=Pentestify), [Andy Li](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qv27bOrxOc&ab_channel=AndyLi), [National French TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcAh20yW8f4&ab_channel=Pentestify) and [Davos](https://www.weforum.org/).
