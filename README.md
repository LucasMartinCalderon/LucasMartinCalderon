- ðŸ”­ I am an currently the Founder & CEO of [Kash](kash.bot), which enables social media users to participate in long-tail prediction markets directly from their feed on their favourite social media apps. I am the creator of the first hybrid bonding curve AMM, which solves the liquidity bootstraping challenge in PMM and the first decentralised and trustless market resolution oracle using zero-knowlege proofs and deterministic, high-reasoning AI. I have equally developed a low-latency trading systems in this space with top players globally.

 - ðŸŒ± I'm pioneering the intersection between artificial intelligence and blockchain, to ensure that web3 does not look anything like 1984, currently focused on DeFi.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always keen and happy to collaborate in the following areas: Prediction Markets, DeFi, blockchain and smart contract security, cutting-edge AI (DRL, GNNs, LLMs, etc.), zero-knowledge proofs, FHE (full homomorphic encryption), and entrepreneurship.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking forward to surrounding myself with exceptionally talented fellow professionals.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about prediction markets, blockchain, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, finance, entrepreneurship, engineering, electronics, among many other interesting topics! I am a frequent speaker at [DeFi Security Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFS0JTh6MCI&ab_channel=DeFiSecuritySummit), [DappCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SFsGFiycSk&ab_channel=Pentestify), [Andy Li](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qv27bOrxOc&ab_channel=AndyLi), [National French TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcAh20yW8f4&ab_channel=Pentestify) and [Davos](https://www.weforum.org/), Token2049, X expert spaces, etc.
